# The Wedding Group Photography Order Problem and how to solve it. 

Your own wedding - one of the most beautiful days in your life, and we all want to keep this moment forever, remember the moments with our guests but also as a couple. Thus it is highly relevant to have a great photographer that is able to capture all these moments.

But besides all the nice and spontaneous shots of laughing and talking guests, in the end everybody expects the perfectly staged group and family photos in each and every combination - with grandparents, without them, with uncles and cousins, without them, ...
... and that takes it's time. 
And after some while we just want to continue with the celebration but still some combinations are missing.

Doesn't that already sound like a perfectly defined combinatorial optimization problem? It is - with a clear objective: minimizing the overall time of taking group photos by choosing an order that allows the smallest amount of guest exchanges.
